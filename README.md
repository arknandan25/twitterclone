# twitterclone
A clone of twitter made in core PHP without any frame work.
This web application is one of my pratice projects in which I use core PHP,Javascript,Mysql,Ajax.It uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.
This applications has all the core functionalty as provided by the original website like logging/signup,creating and tweeting a post ,searching tweets, following/unfollowing other users, viewing your timeline, viewing your recent tweets ,public profiles with chat option.
